# news_site_template
A mock news page for practice purpose - work in progress
Ideas behind implementation:
  . Clean/easy to read top bar
  . One featured article to capture attention
  . Side bar adds flow to information while not distracting reader
  . Card-style news sections lets reader process each one by one rather than being hit with chunks of articles
